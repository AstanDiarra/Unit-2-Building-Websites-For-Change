      <h2>What are the benefits

      </h2>
      <p>Nuclear energy has many benefits. One of them is jobs. Nuclear power plants need 500-800 people for it to
        operate and can last for at least 80 years! This will provide people with long lasting jobs and will not need to
        worry about losing their job. <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes518013.htm"> Power plant operaters get
          a median salary of $80k.</a>

      <h2>How much does it really help Earth?</h2>
      <p> These benefits sound nice and all but how benefitial is it to earth? With climate change being a hot topic
        nowadays, nuclear energy can help remedy the issue. Nuclear energy can be a good source of renewable energy
        and can powerplants do not use coal or fossil fuels which means it produces less carbon dioxide.</p>

      <h2>The misconceptions</h2>
      <p>
        After the Chernobyl incident in Ukraine on April 26, 1986, people are afraid of getting close to nuclear energy.
        This is a well founded worry but nuclear energy is not as dangerous as people think. People believe that they
        will get most of their yearly dose of nuclear energy from powerplants. But this is not true! You actually get
        100 times less radiation from powerplants compared to the amount of radiation you get from coal.<a
